**Overview Headline:** Evaluating the Link Between Digital Literacy and Academic Success in TVET Programs

**Overview:** This project involved a comprehensive review of a manuscript submitted to JTET, examining the relationship between digital literacy and the academic performance of undergraduate students in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) programs. The review assessed the study's methodology, findings, and implications for TVET education.

**Data Details:** The manuscript analyzed data collected through a survey of 59 undergraduate TVET students at a Malaysian university. Key variables included digital literacy skills (information literacy, communication and collaboration, online safety, information access, and task completion) and academic performance (grades in an Information Technology course).

**Problem Statement:** The manuscript seeks to address the need for a better understanding of how digital literacy influences the academic success of TVET students, a crucial aspect of preparing them for today's technology-driven workforce.

**Solution:** The authors conducted a correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between students' self-reported digital literacy levels and their academic performance in an Information Technology course.

**Insight:** The review identified both strengths and weaknesses in the manuscript. While the study employed appropriate methodology and offered valuable insights, concerns were raised regarding the small sample size, lack of detailed descriptions of the digital literacy skills assessed, and the moderate correlation observed.

**Recommendation:** The review recommended revisions to the manuscript, including:

- **Increased sample size:** To enhance the generalizability of the findings.
- **Detailed description of digital literacy skills:** To provide greater clarity and specificity to the study.
- **Exploration of additional factors:** To consider other variables that may influence academic performance, such as socio-economic background and prior digital literacy training.
- **Longitudinal study:** To examine the long-term impact of digital literacy on academic performance.
- **Recommendations for educators and policymakers:** To provide actionable guidance on integrating digital literacy into TVET curricula.
